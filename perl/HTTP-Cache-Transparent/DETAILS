cat << EOF
Perl module to cache the result of http get-requests persistently.

An implementation of http get that keeps a local cache of fetched
pages to avoid fetching the same data from the server if it hasn't
been updated. The cache is stored on disk and is thus persistent
between invocations.

Uses the http-headers If-Modified-Since and ETag to let the server
decide if the version in the cache is up-to-date or not.

The cache is implemented by modifying the LWP::UserAgent class to
seamlessly cache the result of all requests that can be cached.
