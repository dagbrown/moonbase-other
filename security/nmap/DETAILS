cat << EOF
Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It
supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
scanning techniques (determine what services the hosts are offering),
and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host operating system identification).
Nmap also offers flexible target and port specification, decoy scanning,
determination of TCP sequence predictability characteristics, sunRPC
scanning, reverse-identd scanning, and more. Console and X-Window
versions are available.
