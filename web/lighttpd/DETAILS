Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these describe
LigHTTPD which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; as
it is designed and optimized for high performance environments. With
a small memory footprint compared to other web-servers, effective
management of the cpu-load, and advanced feature set (FastCGI, CGI,
Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many more) LigHTTPD is
the perfect solution for every server that is suffering load problems.
