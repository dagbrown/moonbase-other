cat << EOF
ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body dynamics.
It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent with an easy to use
C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection with
friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality
environments and virtual creatures. It is currently used in many computer games,
3D authoring tools and simulation tools.
