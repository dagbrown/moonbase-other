cat << EOF
Librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol.
RELP in turn provides reliable event logging over the network (and consequently
RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol). RELP was initiated by Rainer
Gerhards after he was finally upset by the lossy nature of plain tcp syslog and
wanted a cure for all these dangling issues. RELP (and hence) librelp assures
that no message is lost, not even when connections break and a peer becomes
unavailable.
The current version of RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message
duplication after a session has been broken due to network problems. In this
case, a few messages may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain
tcp syslog). Future versions of RELP will address this shortcoming. Please note
that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even though it was
designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog communication, RELP
supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs provide ample
opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing applications.
