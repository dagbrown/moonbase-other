cat << EOF
International text is mostly encoded in Unicode. For historical reasons, however, it is sometimes still
encoded using a language or country dependent character encoding. With the advent of the internet and
the frequent exchange of text across countries - even the viewing of a web page from a foreign country
is a "text exchange" in this context -, conversions between these encodings have become a necessity.
