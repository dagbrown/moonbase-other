cat << EOF
zug is a C++ library providing transducers. Transducers are composable sequential transformations
independent of the source. They are extremely lightweight, and can be used to express algorithms
over pull-based sequences (iterators, files) but also push based sequences (signals, events,
asynchronous streams) in a generic way.
