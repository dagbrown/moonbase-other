           SHORT="a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression"

cat << EOF
Libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib library, both for
compression and decompression, and especially on x86 processors. In addition, libdeflate
provides optional high compression modes that provide a better compression ratio than the
zlib's "level 9".
