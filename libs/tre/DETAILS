           SHORT="POSIX compliant regexp matching library"

cat << EOF
TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching
library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.
The matching algorithm used in TRE uses linear worst-case time in the length
of the text being searched, and quadratic worst-case time in the length of the
used regular expression.
In other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(M^2N), where M is the
length of the regular expression and N is the length of the text.
The used space is also quadratic on the length of the regex, but does not depend
on the searched string. This quadratic behaviour occurs only on pathological
cases which are probably very rare in practice.
