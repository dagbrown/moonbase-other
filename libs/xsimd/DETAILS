SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors that has been
available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a single operation on a batch of
values at once, and thus provide a way to significantly accelerate code execution.
However, these instructions differ between microprocessor vendors and compilers.

xsimd provides a unified means for using these features for library authors.
