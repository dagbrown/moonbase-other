           SHORT="reference implementation of JPEG XL encoder and decoder"

cat << EOF
This repository contains a reference implementation of JPEG XL (encoder and decoder), called libjxl.
This software library is used by many applications that support JPEG XL.

JPEG XL is in the final stages of standardization and its codestream and file format are frozen.

The library API, command line options, and tools in this repository are subject to change, however
files encoded with cjxl conform to the JPEG XL format specification and can be decoded with current
and future djxl decoders or libjxl decoding library.
