cat << EOF
The purpose of libmspack is to provide compressors and decompressors, archivers and dearchivers
for Microsoft compression formats: CAB, CHM, WIM, LIT, HLP, KWAJ and SZDD. It is also designed
to be easily embeddable, stable, robust and resource-efficient.

The library is not intended as a generalised "any archiver" interface. Users of the library must
explicitly choose the format they intend to work with.
