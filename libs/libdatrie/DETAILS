           SHORT="Implementation of double-array structure for representing trie"

cat << EOF
An implementation of double-array structure for representing trie.
Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with O(1)
time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing, trie also
provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling manipulation.
This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as spelling dictionaries.
