cat << EOF
libtorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ with a focus on high
performance and good code. The library differentiates itself from
other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to the
network stack.  On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3
times the speed of the official client.
