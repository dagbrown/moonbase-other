cat <<EOF
This is program lists all the keys that are bound to some action in i3wm, and
all keys that are not bound to any actions. Now you don't have to search through
your configuration file or going down the track of trial and error anymore.
The program will output one separate keyboard for all of your different modifier
combinations. It will also output each combination for all of your modes.
The keyboard should look like your keymap if everything works as expected :)
