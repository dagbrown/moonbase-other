cat << EOF
Pexpect allows easy control of interactive console applications.
Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling
them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like
Don Libesâ€™ Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and
control it as if a human were typing commands.
