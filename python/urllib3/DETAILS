cat << EOF
urllib3 is a powerful, sanity-friendly HTTP client for Python. Much of
the Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too. urllib3
brings many critical features that are missing from the Python standard
libraries:

  * Thread safety.
  * Connection pooling.
  * Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
  * File uploads with multipart encoding.
  * Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
  * Support for gzip and deflate encoding.
  * Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
  * 100% test coverage.
