cat << EOF
google-auth is the Google authentication library for Python. This library provides the ability
to authenticate to Google APIs using various methods. It also provides integration with several HTTP libraries.

NOTE: The library is the "favored" replacement for python-oauth2client that has been depreciated.
I do not know how many apps/modules have switched so will leave python-oauth2client as is for now.
