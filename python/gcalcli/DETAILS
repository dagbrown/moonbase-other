cat << EOF
gcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google
Calendar(s) from a command line. Itâ€™s easy to get your agenda, search
for events, add new events, delete events, edit events, and even import
those annoying ICS/vCal invites from Microsoft Exchange and/or other
sources.  Additionally, gcalcli can be used as a reminder service and
execute any application you want when an event is coming up.
