cat << EOF
setuptools_scm handles managing your Python package versions in SCM metadata
instead of declaring them as the version argument or in a SCM managed file.
Additionally setuptools_scm provides setuptools with a list of files that are
managed by the SCM (i.e. it automatically adds all of the SCM-managed files to
the sdist). Unwanted files must be excluded by discarding them via MANIFEST.in.
