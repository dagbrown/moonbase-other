RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language
for representing information.

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3, NTriples, Turtle, 
TriX and RDFa. The library presents a Graph interface which can be backed by any
one of a number of store implementations, including, memory, MySQL, Redland, 
SQLite, Sleepycat, ZODB and SQLObject.
