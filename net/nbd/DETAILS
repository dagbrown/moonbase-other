What is it: With this compiled into your kernel, Linux can use a remote server
as one of its block devices. Every time the client computer wants to read
/dev/nbd0, it will send a request to the server via TCP, which will reply with
the data requested. This can be used for stations with low disk space (or even
diskless - if you use an initrd) to borrow disk space from other computers.
Unlike NFS, it is possible to put any file system on it. But (also unlike NFS),
if someone has mounted NBD read/write, you must assure that no one else will
have it mounted.
