cat << EOF
This package contains the libnsl library. This library contains the public
client interface for NIS(YP) and NIS+.
This code was formerly part of glibc, but is now standalone to be able to
link against TI-RPC for IPv6 support.
The NIS(YP) functions are still maintained, the NIS+ part is deprecated and
should not be used anymore.
