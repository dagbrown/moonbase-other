rsync is a replacement for rcp (and scp) that has many more features.
It uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for remote files
into sync. It does this by sending just the differences in the files across the
link, without requiring that both sets of files are present at one of the ends
of the link beforehand.

NOTE: rsync as of 2.6.0, now defaults to using ssh. openssh is now a required
depends of rsync.
