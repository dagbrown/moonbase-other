cat << EOF
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single smallexecutable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you
usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.
The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured
GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected
functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox providesa fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded system.
