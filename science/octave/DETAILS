cat << EOF
Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended for numerical
computations that is mostly compatible with MATLAB. Octave can do arithmetic
for real and complex scalars and matrices, solve sets of nonlinear algebraic
equations, integrate functions over finite and infinite intervals, and integrate
systems of ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations.
