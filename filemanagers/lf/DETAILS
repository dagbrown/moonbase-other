           SHORT="A terminal file manager inspired by ranger"

cat << EOF
lf (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go. It is heavily
inspired by ranger with some missing and extra features. Some of the missing
features are deliberately omitted since they are better handled by external
tools.
