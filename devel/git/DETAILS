Git is a popular version control system designed to handle very large projects
with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools, similar
to e.g. GNU Arch or Monotone (or BitKeeper in the proprietary world). Every
Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking
capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public License v2. It
was originally written by Linus Torvalds and is currently maintained by
Junio C Hamano.
