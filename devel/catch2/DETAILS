cat << EOF
Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also provides basic micro-benchmarking
features, and simple BDD macros.

Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural. Test names do not have to be
valid identifiers, assertions look like normal C++ boolean expressions, and sections provide a
nice and local way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.
