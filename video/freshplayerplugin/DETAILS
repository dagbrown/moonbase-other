As you know, Adobe have suspended further development of Flash player plugin for GNU/Linux. 
Latest available as an NPAPI plugin version 11.2 will get security updates for five years 
(since its release on May 4th, 2012), but further development have been ceased. Fortunately 
or not, newer versions are still available for Linux as a part of Chrome browser, where Flash 
comes bundled in a form of PPAPI plugin. PPAPI or Pepper Plugin API is an interface promoted 
by Chromium/Chrome team for browser plugins. It's NPAPI-inspired yet significantly different 
API which have every concievable function plugin may want.

For various reasons Firefox developers are not interested now in implementing PPAPI in Firefox. 
However that does not mean it cannot be done.

The main goal of this project is to get PPAPI (Pepper) Flash player working in Firefox.

Do note freshplayerplugin at this time does not implement any sandboxing.
