cat << EOF
TinyCDB is a very fast and simple package for creating and reading constant
data bases. It may be used to speed up searches in a sequence of (key,value)
pairs with very big number of records. Example usage is indexing a big list
of users - where a search will require linear reading of a large /etc/passwd
file, and for many other tasks.
It's usage/API is similar to ones found in BerkeleyDB, gdbm and traditional
*nix dbm/ndbm libraries.
