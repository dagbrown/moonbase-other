           SHORT="An enhanced multi-threaded syslogd"

cat <<EOF
Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd with a focus on security
and reliability. Among others, it offers support for on-demand disk
buffering, reliable syslog over TCP, SSL, TLS and RELP, writing
to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more), email
alerting, fully configurable output formats (including high-precision
timestamps), the ability to filter on any part of the syslog message,
on-the-wire message compression, and the ability to convert text
files to syslog. It is a drop-in replacement for stock syslogd and
able to work with the same configuration file syntax.
