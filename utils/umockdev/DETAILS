cat << EOF
umockdev mocks Linux devices for creating integration tests for hardware related libraries
and programs. It also provides tools to record the properties and behaviour of particular
devices, and to run a program or test suite under a test bed with the previously recorded
devices loaded. This allows developers of software like gphoto or libmtp to receive these
records in bug reports and recreate the problem on their system without having access to
the affected hardware.
