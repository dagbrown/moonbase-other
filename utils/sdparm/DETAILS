The sdparm utility outputs and in some cases modifies SCSI device parameters.
When the SCSI device is a disk, sdparm's role is similarto its  namesake: the
linux hdparm utility which is for ATA disks that usually have device names
starting with "hd". More generally sdparm can be used to output and modify
parameters on any device that uses a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks,
such devices include CD/DVD drives (irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI
tape drives and SCSI enclosures. A small set of commands associated with
starting and stopping the media, loading and unloading removable media and some
other housekeeping functions can also be sent by this utility.
