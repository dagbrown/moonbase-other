cat << EOF
The i2c-tools package contains a heterogeneous set of I2C tools for Linux: a bus probing tool, a
chip dumper, register-level SMBus access helpers, EEPROM decoding scripts, EEPROM programming tools,
and a python module for SMBus access. All versions of Linux are supported, as long as I2C support
is included in the kernel.

These tools used to be part of the lm-sensors package, but were later split to a separate package.
