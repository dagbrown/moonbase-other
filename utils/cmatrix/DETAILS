CMatrix is based on the screensaver from The Matrix website. It shows text
flying in and out in a terminal like as seen in "The Matrix" movie. It can
scroll lines all at the same rate or asynchronously and at a user-defined speed.
CMatrix by default operates in eye candy mode. It must be aborted with control-c
(Ctrl+C) or by pressing q. If you wish for more of a screen saver effect, you
must specify -s on the command line. For usage info, use cmatrix -h.
