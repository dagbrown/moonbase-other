cat << EOF
'di' is a disk information utility, displaying everything (and more) that your
'df' command does. It features the ability to display your disk usage in
whatever format you prefer. It also checks the user and group quotas, so that
the user sees the space available for their use, not the system wide disk space.
It is designed to be portable across many platforms.
Great for heterogenous networks.
