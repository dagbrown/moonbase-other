cat << EOF
LimitCPU is a program to throttle the CPU cycles used by other applications.
LimitCPU will monitor a process and make sure its CPU usage stays at or below
a given percentage. This can be used to make sure your system has plenty of
CPU cycles available for other tasks. It can also be used to keep laptops cool
in the face of CPU-hungry processes and for limiting virtual machines.
