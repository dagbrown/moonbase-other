cat << EOF
The libsmbios project aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information
as possible. SMBIOS is a standards-based approach for hardware vendors to
present and structure management data for consumption by OS and Management
Applications. Basically, the system BIOS leaves a small table in memory that can
be found by the OS after system boot. This table has a standardized format that
can easily be parsed by application software.
Several Dell-specific hardware features, such as BIOS update, CMOS Tokens, SMI,
hardware probes (temperature, fan, etc) are represented in the SMBIOS tables.
Because of this, libsmbios has code to enable these features on Dell systems.
