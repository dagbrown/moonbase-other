cat << EOF
The rcm suite of tools is for managing dotfiles directories.
This is a directory containing all the .*rc files in your home directory
(.zshrc, .vimrc, and so on). These files have gone by many names in history,
such as “rc files” because they typically end in rc or “dotfiles” because
they begin with a period.
This suite is useful for committing your rc files to a central repository to
share, but it also scales to a more complex situation such as multiple source
directories shared between computers with some host-specific or task-specific
files.
