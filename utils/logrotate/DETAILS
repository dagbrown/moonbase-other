cat << EOF
The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
log files on a system which generates a lot of log files. Logrotate
allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal, and mailing of
log files. Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
monthly, or when the log file gets to a certain size. Normally,
logrotate runs as a daily cron job.
