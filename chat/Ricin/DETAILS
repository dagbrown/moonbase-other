cat << EOF
Ricin aims to be a secure, lightweight, hackable and fully-customizable chat
client using the awesome and open-source ToxCore library. We know that there
are several Tox clients but this project was initially made because the other
clients were missing many features that users have been waiting for over many
months.
Ricin is a simple but powerful cross-platform client written in Vala and using
Gtk+ 3.0.
