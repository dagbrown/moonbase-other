TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by
converting them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with
digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time,
and plays. It can not only play sounds, but also can save the generated
waveforms into hard disks as various audio file formats.
