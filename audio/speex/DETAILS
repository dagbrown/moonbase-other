cat << EOF
Speex is an Open Source/Free Software  patent-free audio compression
format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the barrier
of entry for voice applications by providing a free alternative to
expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex is well-adapted to
Internet applications and provides useful features that are not present
in most other codecs.
