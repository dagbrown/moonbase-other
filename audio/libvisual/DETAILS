           SHORT="An abstraction library that comes between applications and audio visualisation plugins"

cat << EOF
Often when it comes to audio visualisation plugins or programs that
create visuals, they depend on a player or something else; basically,
there is no general framework that enabled application developers to
easily access cool audio visualisation plugins.  Libvisual wants to
change this by providing an interface towards plugins and applications;
through this easy to use interface applications can easily access
plugins and, since the drawing is done by the application, it also
enables the developer to draw the visual anywhere he wants.

The framework also allows you to morph to different plugins and mix two
at once; all kinds of neat tricks are possible using this method.
