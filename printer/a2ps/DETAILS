a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter. Of course it processes plain text
files, but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages (66).
Moreover it has the ability to delegate the processing of some files to
other filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), which allows
a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection etc.) of heterogeneous files.
