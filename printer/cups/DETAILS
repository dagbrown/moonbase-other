cat << EOF
CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based operating systems. It
has been developed to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley commandline interfaces, uses
the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for managing print jobs and
queues, supports (with reduced functionality) the Line Printer Daemon ("LPD"),
Server Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols, and
adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based
printing options to support real-world printing under UNIX. CUPS also includes
a customized version of GNU Ghostscript and an image file RIP that are used to
support non-PostScript printers. Sample drivers for HP and EPSON printers are
included that use these filters.
