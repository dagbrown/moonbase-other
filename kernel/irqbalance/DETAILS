cat << EOF
Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated by interrupts
across all of a systems cpus.  Irqbalance identifies the highest volume
interrupt sources, and isolates them to a single unique cpu, so that load is
spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while minimizing cache
hit rates for irq handlers.
