Intel® Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels, developed at Intel. The target users of
Intel® Embree are graphics application engineers who want to improve the performance of their photo-realistic
rendering application by leveraging Embree’s performance-optimized ray tracing kernels. The kernels are optimized
for the latest Intel® processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. Intel® Embree supports
runtime code selection to choose the traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction set of your
CPU. We recommend using Intel® Embree through its API to get the highest benefit from future improvements.

Intel® Embree is released as Open Source under the Apache 2.0 license.
