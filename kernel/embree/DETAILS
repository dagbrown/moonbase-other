Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels, developed at Intel.
The target users of Embree are graphics application engineers who want to improve
the performance of their photo-realistic rendering application by leveraging Embree's
performance-optimized ray tracing kernels. The kernels are optimized for the latest Intel
processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. Embree supports
runtime code selection to choose the traversal and build algorithms that best matches
the instruction set of your CPU. We recommend using Embree through its API to get the
highest benefit from future improvements.

Embree is released as Open Source under the Apache 2.0 license.
