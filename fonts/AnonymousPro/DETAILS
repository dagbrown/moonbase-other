Anonymous Pro (2009) is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed with coding
in mind. Anonymous Pro features an international, Unicode-based character set,
with support for most Western and Central European Latin-based languages, plus
Greek and Cyrillic. Anonymous Pro is based on an earlier font, Anonymous (2001),
my TrueType version of Anonymous 9, a Macintosh bitmap font developed in the
mid-1990s by Susan Lesch and David Lamkins.
Anonymous Pro is distributed with the Open Font License (OFL).
