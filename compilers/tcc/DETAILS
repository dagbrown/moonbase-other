cat << EOF
TinyCC (aka TCC) is a small but hyper fast C compiler. Unlike other
C compilers, it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an
external assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.
TCC compiles so fast that even for big projects Makefiles may not
be necessary.
TCC not only supports ANSI C, but also most of the new ISO C99
standard and many GNUC extensions including inline assembly.
TCC can also be used to make C scripts, i.e. pieces of C source that
you run as a Perl or Python script. Compilation is so fast that your
script will be as fast as if it was an executable.
