Owl Lisp is a functional dialect of the Scheme programming language.
It is mainly based on the applicative subset of the R7RS standard.
Owl can be used either interactively, or to interpret code from files,
or compile programs to fasl-images or c-files. The difference between
an owl program and a plain script is that the program should just have
a function of one argument as the last value, which will be called with
the command line argument list when the program is executed.
