Janet is a functional and imperative programming language. It runs on Windows,
Linux, macOS, BSDs, and should run on other systems with some porting. The
entire language (core library, interpreter, compiler, assembler, PEG) is less
than 1Mb. You can also add Janet scripting to an application by embedding a
single C file and two headers.
