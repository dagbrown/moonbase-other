cat << EOF
Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination
of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.
It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.
