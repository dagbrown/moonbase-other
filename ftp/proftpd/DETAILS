ProFTPD is a proven, high-performance, scalable FTP server written from scratch,
with a focus toward simplicity, security, and ease of configuration. Naturally,
ProFTPD powers some of the largest sites on the Internet.
It features a very Apache-like configuration syntax, modules, and a highly
customizable server infrastructure, including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP
servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory visibility.
