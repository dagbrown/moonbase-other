While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings(tm), it has included some
other ideas, which weren't presented in the original Lemmings(tm), like
the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games the Super
Mario World and other Nintendo games. We have also a few new actions, like
the jumper which weren't presented in the original game.
