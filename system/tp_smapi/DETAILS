           SHORT="Modules for ThinkPad's SMAPI functionality"

cat << EOF
ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS (System
Management Application Program Interface) which provides some hardware control
functionality that is not accessible by other means.
This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs interface.
It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked through IO port
writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface; for those, try the
"thinkpad" module from the "tpctl" package.
