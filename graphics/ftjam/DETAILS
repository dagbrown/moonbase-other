Jam is a small open-source build tool that is used as a replacement for Make.
Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, it is far more powerful and
easy to master. It already works on a large variety of platforms (Unix, Windows,
OS/2, VMS, MacOS, BeOS, etc.).
The main differences between Jam and Make are as follows:
 - Jam uses ‘Jamfiles’ instead of ‘Makefiles’.
 - Jamfiles do not normally contain toolset-specific rules or actions. They are
   thus portable among distinct compilers.
 - Jamfiles are a lot simpler than Makefiles to write and understand, while
   providing the same functionality, and much, much more.
