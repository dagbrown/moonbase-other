cat << EOF
GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. It provides a robust
collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and
manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like
DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, SVG, and TIFF.
GraphicsMagick supports huge images on systems that support large files, and has
been tested with gigapixel-size images.
