cat << EOF
WebP is a new image format that provides lossy compression for photographic
images. In a large scale study of 900,000 web images, WebP images were 39.8%
smaller than jpeg images of similar quality.

A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container based on RIFF. The
standalone libwebp library serves as a reference implementation for the WebP
specification and is available at this git repository and as a tarball.
Webmasters and web developers can use the WebP image format to create smaller
and better looking images that can help make the web faster.

The easiest use should look like:
  cwebp input.png -q 80 -o output.webp
which will convert the input PNG or JPEG file to a WebP one using a
quality factor of 80 on a 0->100 scale (0 being the lowest quality,
100 being the best. Default value is 75).
