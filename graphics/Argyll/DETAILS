cat << EOF
ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system. It supports accurate ICC
profile creation for scanners, cameras and film recorders, and calibration and
profiling of displays and RGB & CMYK printers. Device Link can be created with a
wide variety of advanced options, including specialized Video calibration
standards  and 3dLuts. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection
of illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive
compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for
perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the
CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide
selection of rendering intents. It also includes code for the fastest portable
8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support for
fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed
and compared with a modern Web browser using X3DOM.
