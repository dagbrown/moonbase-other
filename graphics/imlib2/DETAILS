cat << EOF
Imlib2 is the successor to Imlib. It is NOT a newer version - it is a
completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside Imlib 1.x without
any problems since they are effectively different libraries which have very
similar functionality. Please see the homepage for the long description of the
differences.
