cat << EOF
pngquant is a command-line utility and a library for lossy compression of PNG
images.
The conversion reduces file sizes significantly (often as much as 70%) and
preserves full alpha transparency.
Generated images are compatible with all modern web browsers, and have better
fallback in IE6 than 24-bit PNGs.
Features
  High-quality palette generation using a combination of vector quantization
  algorithms.
  Unique adaptive dithering algorithm that adds less noise to images than the
  standard Floyd-Steinberg.
  Easy to integrate with shell scripts, GUIs and server-side software.
  Fast mode for processing large numbers of images.
