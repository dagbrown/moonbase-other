cat << EOF
pngquant is a command-line utility and a library for lossy compression of PNG images.

The conversion reduces file sizes significantly (often as much as 70%) and preserves full alpha transparency.
Generated images are compatible with all modern web browsers, and have better fallback in IE6 than 24-bit PNGs.

Features

High-quality palette generation using a combination of vector quantization algorithms.
Unique adaptive dithering algorithm that adds less noise to images than the standard Floyd-Steinberg.
Easy to integrate with shell scripts, GUIs and server-side software.
Fast mode for processing large numbers of images.
