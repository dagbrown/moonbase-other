           SHORT="A library that simplifies the interaction with PKCS11 providers"

cat << EOF
A library that simplifies the interaction with PKCS11 providers for end-user
applications using a simple API and optional OpenSSL engine.
pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at the same time,
enumerating available token certificates, or selecting a certificate directly
by serialized id, handling card removal and card insert events, handling card
re-insert to a different slot, supporting session expiration and much more all
using a simple API.
pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object attributes
are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to access existing
objects in order to perform signature and decryption.
