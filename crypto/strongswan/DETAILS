cat << EOF
strongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation for the Linux operating
system. It is based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and the X.509
patch which we developped over the last three years. In order to have a
stable IPsec platform to base our future extensions of the X.509
capability on, we decided to lauch the strongSwan project.
